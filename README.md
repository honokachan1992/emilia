# エミーリーアー

A multi-purpose discord bot written in Swift(4+).
As of right now it's still a work in progress, but it does what I initially wanted it to do: interact with the danbooru API.

## Available commands

- !danbooru your_tag (Sends a picture from danbooru that matches the specified tag.s)
- !avatar (Sends a direct URL to your avatar) //can't get that one to work for some reason
